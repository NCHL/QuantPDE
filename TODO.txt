- Control lookback to store controls (do this inside ControlledLinearSystem)

- Controls that do not need to be interpolated are currently interpolated
  for an unecessary cost of O(NlgN) per iteration (N is the number of nodes in
  the domain)

- It currently matters what order each linear system is associated with an
  iteration; this is bad
	- Possible solution 1: Each Iteration has to specify a list of members
	- Possible solution 2: Each IterationNode has to associate with an
	                       Iteration on creation
	- Possible solution 3: Infer the order from the associations between
	                       iteration nodes (automatic)
- Step into feature for iterations

- Lazy sparse matrix creation

- Remove branching in BlackScholes.hpp

- Allow for control domains which are a function of time and space

- Automagic grid creation

- Migrate to CMake

- Parallelize
	- General producer/consumer queue
	- Parallelize policy iteration by splitting domain
