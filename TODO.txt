- Control lookback
- Controls that do not need to be interpolated are currently interpolated
- It currently matters what order each linear system is associated with an
  iteration; this is bad
	- Possible solution 1: Each Iteration has to specify a list of members
	- Possible solution 2: Each IterationNode has to associate with an
	                       Iteration on creation
- Step into feature for iterations
- Lazy sparse matrix creation
- Remove branching in BlackScholes.hpp
- Allow for control domains which are a function of time and space
- Automagic grid creation
- Migrate to CMake
- Parallelize
